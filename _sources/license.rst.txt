For historical reasons (PyFtdi has been initially developed as a compatibility
layer with libftdi_), the main ``ftdi.py`` file had originally been licensed
under the same license as the libftdi_ project, the GNU Lesser General Public
License LGPL v2 license. It does not share code from this project anymore, but
implements a similar API.

From my perspective, you may use it freely in open source or close source, free
or commercial projects as long as you comply with the BSD 3-clause license.
